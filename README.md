# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction With Machine Learning

This repo contains all the source code of my HarvardX Capstone Project in the [Data Science Program](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science).

The final reports are generated with the files inside the `templates` folder using the `generate_papers.py` script. It generates two versions, english and portuguese. All the contend inside the templates files are marked for translation with custom tags, including the code.

Files inside the `generated` folder should not be edited. Work only with the `templates`.
